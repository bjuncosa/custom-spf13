============

custom-spf13 modified to edit puppet and python

Installation
============

First follow the installation instructions from:

 * https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim

After you have this installed, you can download the .vimrc.local and .vimrc.bundles.local files and copy them to your home directory.

When you have done this, you can enter vim and type: 

 * ":BundleInstall"
   * This will install all bundles that are missing
 * ":BundleClean"
   * This will erase the bundles which I don't need from spf13.
